**PLEASE NOTE** 

Index.html is used as a source code "include" in the [Tutorial: Explore the Time Series Insights JavaScript client library](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/time-series-insights/tutorial-explore-js-client-lib) article. Specifically, [!code-javascript] directives are used to pull in snippets and highlight them as necessary.

As such, the copy of index.html in this folder is a static copy of the one used to publish the https://insights.timeseries.azure.com/clientsample web app, and matches the latest version of the article. This allows the article and the index.html source to stay in sync. 

**Please ensure the article gets updated in sync with changes to index.html.**
